lovelang is a program that helps you learn and love languages!

## why use us?
it uses conversations, syllables, and a regular curriculum to make learning a breeze 💨 

## why?
we didn't like how other programs only focused on reading and writing; when you go to a country, will you just write instead of talking? 🤔

## how do we solve that problem?
so we approached it by learning by doing. by conversing with an ai, you'll learn it much better and gain much more confidence while talking to natives.

when talking with the ai, each voice is never the same. it'll feel like talking to a new person each time!🤯

## features
learn by conversing 🤖
- each voice is different👂
- learn to talk, not just read and write 📝
practice syllables 🗣️
- step-by-step, making sure that you get it on point
- never mess up ever again!
follow a regular curriculum📚
- we don't hate reading and writing, but we feel as if speaking would benefit a learner much more
- through curated curriculum, learn with more confidence

## installation (for now)
download the repository 💻
in your terminal, run
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
grab a google cloud cred (we'll do this for you once we get it up & running)
run as a file and start learning!

## usage
- start a conversation with the ai 💬
- learn from the curriculum you have after signing up
- practice step-bystep with syllables 🗣️
- most importantly, have fun! 🥳
