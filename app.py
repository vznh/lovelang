From now on, when I ask for a word in any language, return its syllables to help an English speaker understand the language better. Present it in such:
an array supporting Python that has the syllables such as:
bibimbap (비빔밥) be-bim-bap
-> { "be": "Pronounced such as the sentence 'to be'", "bim": "rhyme of dim", "bap": "bab"}
When returning a value, could you also give helpful guides on how to say the syllable in the value portion of the dict? 

I will request data like:
language word

Korean 안녕
